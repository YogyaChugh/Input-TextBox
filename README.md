I created this really looong time ago....
The main reason was to have a textbox input logic prepared for my next big project "My own browser" !
I was new and hence, this was quite a noob move but it did teach me a lot ups and downs!
Kept it for my future memories  !!!! You can try it though


`Make sure to have mingw installed and added to ur system's env variables`

Clone this and run
```bash
g++ input.cpp -o input.exe -Iinclude -Llib -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
```
OR
You can just download the release from the repo !

`Be sure to find lagging and the lowest text quality on Earth ! But the code taught me how to write lengthy codes and get out from that just learning language syntax phase.`

`And not forgetting the good time of learning the SDL2 library as well as exploring [Freetype](https://freetype.org/)`

Btw, soon coming my own browser but with a diff approach
